# Wakatime update Julay 2023
 Sadly wakeapi.com dosnÂ´t provide the full history like it used to anymore, you now have to buy premium to get your full 2 years of history, you can then unsibscribe and it will still work.
 Once fully fetched you can run it once every couple of days (within the 2 weeks) like you used to.

## Requirements
NodeJS 16+  
Python 3+  
InfluxDB 2.X  
Grafana 9.X  

## Setup
1. Clone the repo localy
2. Create a bucket called WakaTime in influx and a token with write permissions to it
3. Rename .env.example to .env and fill it out
4. Run `npm i`
5. Run `node index.js`
6. Import grafana_wakatime.json into your grafana (Check your datasource)
7. (Optional) Add a cronjob or something that will run it once every day
